# Data Strutures
Data structures are formats that organise, process, retrieve and store data. These formats can be primitive or non - primitive. Primitive data structures contain primitive data, such as int, float, character and boolean, that are of the same type, whereas non-primitive data structures are the opposite. Elements within non-primitive structures can either be ordered or not and if they have been ordered, their structure's memory size can either be or not be updated during runtime.
The following diagrams display what has been discussed:

## Arrays and Lists
Collection of items of the same type, accessed by index. However, unlike lists, arrays have fixed size and their elements cannot be modified after they are created.
* 2D Array: Array of arrays where the outer array's indices represent's the matrix's columns, whilst the inner array's indices represents the matrix's rows.

* ## Linked lists: _A structure, in which the elements that are linked using pointers are not stored at contiguous memory locations._

* Queues and Stacks: Queues retrieve the first item added, while stacks retrieve the last item added. 

## Graphs
A connected or disconnected structure consisting of vertices that have unweighted or weighted edges or cycles that are either directed or not.

* [Trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-tree-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/): A hierarchical collection of nodes that are connected by edges. The hierachy consists of a root node that are connected to child nodes that can have multiple child nodes that can have child nodes themselves.

## Hash table
_A technique or process of mapping keys, and values into the hash table by using a hash function._

## Sets
An unordered collection of unique and deletable items that supports adding new items and automatically discards duplicates.
