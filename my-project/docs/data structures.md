# Data structures

Data structures are formats that organise, process, retrieve and store data. These formats can be primitive or non - primitive. Primitive data structures contain primitive data, such as int, float, character and boolean, that are of the same type, whereas non-primitive data structures are the opposite. Elements within non-primitive structures can either be ordered or not and if they have been ordered, their structure's memory size can either be or not be updated during runtime.
